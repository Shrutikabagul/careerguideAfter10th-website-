Among the above mentioned subjects, Physics, Chemistry, English and Mathematics/Biology are compulsory subjects. Students have to 

choose an optional subject other than them. Usually, availability of such optional subjects may vary from one board to another and 

from one state board to another. Usually, the optional subjects are- computer science, Sanskrit, regional languages etc.

 

ACADEMIC PROGRAM AND EVALUATION
There are two academic years present- 11th and 12th standards. In case of some boards and state boards, the each academic year has 

been divided into two semesters, each semester lasting a period of 6 months. Main evaluation exams are held at the end of each 

academic year (at the end of each semester, in case of semester learning system).

 

PROFESSIONAL COURSES AFTER 12TH
Professional courses available after 12th can roughly be classified into three types- applied science courses, pure science 

courses and other courses. Such courses are available in Diploma as well as Bachelor’s Degree formats.
