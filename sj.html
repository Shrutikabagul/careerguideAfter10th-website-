Opportunities Galore – Streams | Career Options | Jobs
The biggest decision post class 10 is picking the right stream. Picking the right stream is extremely important as everything that happens thereafter will depend on it. At times, students follow the herd mentality and pick the stream which their friends opt for or the one that their parents suggest. This is a wrong and dangerous practice and will lead to flawed career decisions. Many students pick the stream without actually understanding what lies in store for them after joining it. Therefore, proper understanding and knowledge of the stream you opt for and the future career options they offer, is very important. Following are the different streams that are available after Class 10.

<h1>1. Science – The Usual Favourite</h1>

Science is easily the most attractive stream and the one that almost every parent wants their child to opt for. The Science stream offers you many lucrative career options such as engineering, medical, IT and computer science and even research in a variety of domains. The biggest advantage of opting for science stream for Class 10 students is that it allows them to shift streams (Arts or Commerce) later on in their academic career. Simply put, a Science student can opt for any subject from Arts or Commerce stream, if they are not comfortable with courses or specialization offered in it at the graduation level. On the contrary, Arts or Commerce students do not enjoy this option and are not allowed to pick science subjects for under graduate courses.
